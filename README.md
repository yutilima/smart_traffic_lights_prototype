# smart_traffic_lights_prototype
This is a project that i created in my 1st period on UFF. It's a simple electronic circuit powered by an arduino (blackboard) that simulates a crossroad, implementig a smart traffic light. The circuit is composed by two light sensors, detecting when the traffic  is too intense, based on the period of time that a car is stopped, blocking the light.
